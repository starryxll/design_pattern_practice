Composite pattern

This pattern is used to unify or enclose a whole set of classes, such that all
the classes or objects im the "composition" can use the same interface's method.

This pattern is usually used in tree or graph structure when we merge nodes into a whole
set of nodes or integrated tree/graph data structure. By doing this, we can use
just one interface to operate on all the nodes on the tree or graph.
